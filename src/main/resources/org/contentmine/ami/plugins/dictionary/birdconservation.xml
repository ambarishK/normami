Wilson  Bull.,  106(1),  1994,  pp.  121-137   A  GLOSSARY  FOR  AVIAN  CONSERVATION  BIOLOGY  ROLF  R.  KOFORD,'  JOHN  B.  DUNNING,  JR.,2  CHRISTINE  A.  RIBIC,3  AND  DEBORAH  M.  FINCH4  ABSTRACT.-This  glossary  provides  standard  definitions  for  many  of  the  terms  used  in  avian  conservation  biology.  We  compiled  these  definitions  to  assist  communication  among  researchers,  managers,  and  others  involved  in  the  Neotropical  Migratory  Bird  Conservation  Program,  also  known  as  Partners  in  Flight.  We  used  existing  glossaries  and  recent  literature  to  prepare  this  glossary.  The  cited  sources  were  not  necessarily  the  first  ones  to  use  the  terms.  Many  definitions  were  taken  verbatim  from  the  cited  source  material.  Others  were  modified  slightly  to  clarify  the  meaning.  Definitions  that  were  modified  to  a  greater  extent  are  indicated  as  being  adapted  from  the  originals.  Terms  that  have  been  used  in  more  than  one  way  by  different  authors  are  listed  with  numbered  alternative  definitions  if  the  definitions  differ  substantially.  Received  30  March  1993,  accepted  23  July  1993.

Vol. 
106, 
No. 
1, 
March 
1994 
Biodiversity: 
(1) 
the 
variety 
of 
life 
forms, 
the 
ecological 
roles 
they 
perform, 
and 
the 
genetic 
diversity 
they 
contain 
(Wilcox 
1984:640); 
(2) 
the 
variety 
from 
molecular, 
population, 
and 
interspecific 
levels 
up 
to 
the 
heterogeneity 
of 
ecosystems 
and 
landscapes 
(Hansen 
and 
diCastri 
1992:5) 
(syn. 
biological 
diversity). 
Biogeography: 
the 
study 
of 
the 
geographic 
distributions 
of 
organisms, 
both 
past 
and 
present 
(Brown 
and 
Gibson 
1983:557). 
Biological 
species 
concept: 
the 
idea 
that 
species 
are 
groups 
of 
natural 
populations 
that 
are 
reproductively 
isolated 
from 
other 
such 
groups 
(McKitrick 
and 
Zink 
1988:2) 
(cf 
Phylo- 
genetic 
species 
concept). 
Biomarker: 
the 
variation, 
induced 
by 
a substance 
foreign 
to 
the 
body, 
in 
cellular 
or 
bio- 
chemical 
components 
or 
processes, 
structures, 
or 
functions 
that 
is measurable 
in 
a bio- 
logical 
system 
or 
sample 
(McCarthy 
et 
al. 
1991:2). 
Boundary: 
the 
edge 
between 
different 
habitat 
types. 
If 
distinctive, 
a 
boundary 
can 
be 
con- 
sidered 
a 
separate 
edge 
habitat 
or 
ecotone. 
Boundaries 
that 
are 
readily 
crossed 
by 
an 
organism 
are 
called 
permeable, 
those 
that 
are 
crossed 
reluctantly 
are 
called 
semipermeable, 
and 
those 
that 
are 
not 
crossed 
are 
called 
impermeable 
(Dunning 
et 
al. 
1992:173).

American 
breeding 
birds 
by 
using 
point 
counts 
along 
roads

have 
reproduced 
between 
successive 
breeding 
sites 
(Greenwood

Brood 
parasitism 
(interspecific): 
the 
laying

of other 
species 
with 
subsequent 
care 
for 
the 
parasite 
young 
provided 
by 
the 
hosts 
(Lanyon 
1992:77) 
(syn. 
breeding 
parasitism, 
nest 
parasitism 
[Thomson 
1964:594]). 
Capture-recapture 
method: 
a 
procedure 
involving 
the 
distinctive 
marking

estimate 
population 
size 
and 
other 
pop- 
ulation 
parameters 
(Ralph 
1981:577) 
(syn. 
mark-recapture). 
Carrying 
capacity: 
the 
maximum 
number 
of 
individuals 
that 
can 
use 
a 
given 
area 
of 
habitat 
without 
degrading 
the 
habitat 
and 
without 
causing 
social 
stresses 
that 
result 
in 
population 
reduction 
(McNeely 
et 
al. 
1990:153). 
Catastrophe: 
an 
event 
that 
causes 
sudden

a total 
population 
for 
that 
area 
(Ralph 
1981:577). 
Census 
efficiency: 
proportion

of 
all 
species 
observed 
within 
a circle 
that 
is 
15 
miles 
(24 
km) 
in 
diameter 
(Ralph 
1981:

Direct 
competition: 
the 
exclusion 
of 
individuals 
from 
resources 
by 
aggressive 
behavior 
or 
use 
of 
toxins 
(Ricklefs 
1979:868). 
Dispersal: 
the 
movement 
of 
organisms 
away 
from 
the 
place 
of 
birth 
or 
from 
centers 
of 
population 
density 
(Ricklefs 
1979:868) 
(see 
Breeding 
dispersal, 
Natal 
dispersal). 
Dispersion: 
(1) 
the 
pattern 
of 
spacing 
of 
individuals 
in 
a 
population 
(Ricklefs 
1979:868); 
(2) 
the 
nonaccidental 
movement 
of 
individuals 
into 
or 
out 
of 
an 
area 
or 
population, 
typically 
a movement 
over 
a 
relatively 
short 
distance 
and 
of 
a 
regular 
nature 
(Lincoln 
et 
al. 
1982:70). 
Disturbance: 
any 
relatively 
discrete 
event 
in 
time 
that 
disrupts 
ecosystem, 
community, 
or 
population 
structure 
and 
changes 
resources, 
substrate 
availability, 
or 
the 
physical 
envi- 
ronment 
(Turner 
1989:181). 
Diversity: 
typically 
used 
in 
relation 
to 
species, 
a 
single 
index 
that 
incorporates 
the 
number 
of 
species 
and 
relative 
abundances 
of 
species 
(evenness). 
For 
example, 
a collection 
is said 
to 
have 
high 
diversity 
if 
it 
has 
many 
species 
and 
their 
abundances 
are 
relatively 
even. 
There 
are 
many 
types 
of 
diversity 
(Pielou 
1977:292; 
Wiens 
1989a:123): 
Point

a  small 
or 
microhabitat

or 
set 
of 
samples 
including 
more 
than 
one 
kind 
of 
community 
Delta

will 
persist 
in 
a 
viable

Multi-brooded: 
producing 
more 
than 
one 
clutch 
or 
brood 
per 
season 
(Ricklefs 
1972:401), 
usually 
in 
reference 
to 
a  life 
history 
trait 
of 
a 
species. 
Natal 
dispersal: 
movement 
from 
birth 
(natal) 
site 
to 
first 
breeding 
or 
potential 
breeding 
site 
(Greenwood 
1980:1141). 
Neighborhood 
effect: 
increased 
impact 
of 
landscape 
features 
located 
in 
the 
immediate 
neigh- 
borhood 
of 
a 
focal 
patch 
compared 
with 
features 
farther 
from 
the 
local 
patch 
(Dunning 
et 
al. 
1992:173). 
Neotropical 
migrant: 
a 
migratory 
bird 
in 
the 
Neotropical 
faunal 
region. 
The 
Neotropical 
Migratory 
Bird 
Conservation 
Program 
focuses 
primarily 
on 
species 
that 
nest 
in 
the 
Ne- 
arctic 
faunal 
region 
and 
winter 
in 
the 
Neotropical 
region 
(Stangel 
1992). 
Nest 
parasitism: 
(1) 
expression 
used 
by 
some 
authors 
(e.g., 
Thomson 
1964:594, 
Monroe 
1991:225) 
for 
brood 
parasitism; 
(2) 
taking 
over 
nests 
of 
other 
species 
(Lanyon 
1992:78). 
Nest 
success: 
survival 
of 
eggs 
or 
nestlings 
(usually 
excluding 
those 
of 
brood 
parasites) 
(May- 
field 
1975:459) 
(see 
Hatching 
success). 
Net 
reproductive 
rate: 
the 
number 
of 
offspring 
that 
females 
are 
expected 
to 
bear 
on 
average 
during 
their 
lifetimes 
(Ricklefs 
1979:875). 
Niche: 
multidimensional 
utilization 
distribution, 
giving 
a 
population's 
use 
of 
resources 
or- 
dered 
along 
resource 
axes 
(Schoener 
1989:79). 
Numerical 
response: 
change 
in 
the 
population 
size 
of 
a 
predatory 
species 
as 
a 
result 
of 
a 
change 
in 
the 
density 
of 
its 
prey 
(Ricklefs 
1979:876) 
(cf 
Functional 
response). 
Parameter: 
(1) 
A 
statistical 
parameter 
is 
a 
numerical 
characteristic 
about 
the 
population 
of 
interest 
(Freedman 
et 
al. 
1978:301); 
(2) 
A 
model 
parameter 
is 
a  numerical 
quantity 
that 
mediates 
the 
relationships 
between 
variables 
in 
a 
model 
(Starfield 
and 
Bleloch 
1986:4). 
Partners 
in 
Flight:

to 
conserve 
neotropical 
mi- 
gratory 
birds 
and 
officially 
endorsed 
by 
numerous 
federal 
and 
state 
agencies 
and 
nongov- 
ernment 
organization 
(National 
Fish

Wildlife 
Foundation 
1992:1). 
Also

Patch 
dynamics: 
the 
change 
in 
the 
distribution 
of 
habitat 
patches 
in 
a 
landscape 
generated 
by 
patterns 
of 
disturbance 
and 
subsequent 
patterns 
of 
vegetative 
succession 
(Pickett 
and 
Thompson 
1978:29). 
Pattern: 
a  statement 
about 
relationships 
among 
several 
observations 
of 
nature. 
It 
connotes 
a 
particular 
configuration 
of 
properties 
of 
the 
system 
under 
investigation 
(Wiens 
1989a: 
18). 
Perennial: 
referring 
to 
an 
organism 
that 
lives 
for 
more 
than 
one 
year 
(Ricklefs 
1979:876). 
Phenotype: 
the 
way 
in 
which 
the 
genetic 
message 
of 
an 
individual 
is 
expressed 
in 
its 
mor- 
phology, 
physiology, 
and 
behavior 
(Brown 
and 
Gibson 
1983:567). 
Phylogenetic 
species 
concept: 
the 
idea 
that 
a 
species 
is 
the 
smallest 
diagnosable 
cluster 
of 
individual 
organisms 
within 
which 
there 
is 
a 
parental 
pattern 
of 
ancestry 
and

(McKitrick 
and 
Zink 
1988:2) 
(cf 
Biological 
species 
concept). 
Physiognomy: 
the

etation 
(Brown 
and 
Gibson 
1983:568). 
Point 
count 
method: 
count 
of 
contacts 
recorded 
by 
an 
observer 
from 
a  fixed 
observation 
point 
and

time 
interval: 
fixed 
distance 
(radius) 
point 
count 
is 
limited 
to 
individuals 
within 
a 
single 
fixed 
distance; 
variable 
distance 
(radius) 
point 
count 
is limited 
to 
individuals 
within 
distances 
varying 
according 
to 
species-characteristic 
detection 
dis- 
tances 
(syn. 
variable 
circular 
plot); 
and 
unlimited 
distance 
point 
count 
includes 
all 
indi- 
viduals 
without 
limits, 
that 
is, 
all 
detections 
recorded 
regardless 
of

Ponctuels 
d'Abondance" 
[IPA]

Polymorphism: 
occurrence 
of 
more 
than 
one 
distinct 
form 
of 
individuals 
in 
a 
population 
(Ricklefs 
1979:877). 
Population: 
a 
group 
of 
coexisting 
(conspecific) 
individuals 
that 
interbreed 
if 
they 
are 
sexually 
reproductive 
(Sinclair 
1989). 
Population 
viability 
analysis 
(PVA): 
analysis 
that 
estimates 
minimum 
viable 
populations 
(Gilpin 
and 
Soul6 
1986:19) 
(syn. 
population 
vulnerability 
analysis). 
Postfledging 
mortality: 
the 
death 
rate 
of 
young 
after 
fledging, 
calculated 
from 
the 
following: 
the 
fates 
of 
young 
birds 
after 
fledging 
(or 
hatching 
in 
the 
case 
of 
precocial 
young), 
when 
these 
fates 
can 
be 
observed 
directly; 
changes 
in 
the 
ratio 
between 
juvenile 
and 
adult 
birds 
in 
populations; 
and 
the 
number 
of 
surviving 
young 
needed 
to 
replace 
adult 
losses, 
when 
adult 
mortality 
rates 
and 
the 
production 
of 
fledglings 
are 
known 
(Ricklefs 
1972:373). 
Precision: 
a 
quality, 
associated 
with 
a class 
of 
measurements, 
that 
refers 
to 
the 
way 
in 
which 
repeated 
observations 
conform 
to 
themselves 
(Marriott 
1990:159). 
Primary 
succession: 
the 
sequence 
of 
communities 
developing 
in 
a 
newly 
exposed 
site 
devoid 
of 
life 
(Ricklefs 
1979:877). 
Process: 
the 
operation 
of 
some 
factor 
or 
factors 
that 
produce 
a 
particular 
relationship 
among 
observations 
(Wiens 
1989a: 
19). 
Productivity: 
the 
number 
of 
young 
produced 
per 
pair 
of 
birds, 
or 
the 
reproductive 
perfor- 
mance 
of 
the 
population, 
estimated 
as 
the 
proportion 
of 
young 
in 
the 
total 
population 
just 
after 
the 
breeding 
season 
(Ricklefs 
1972:417). 
Proximate 
factors: 
aspects 
of 
the 
environment 
that 
organisms 
use 
as 
cues 
for 
behavior; 
for 
example, 
daylength 
(Ricklefs 
1979:877) 
(cf 
Ultimate 
factors). 
Quadrat: 
a small 
sample 
plot, 
usually 
square 
or 
rectangular 
(Ralph 
1981:578). 
Rate 
of 
increase: 
a 
measurement 
of 
the 
change 
in 
numbers 
of 
a 
population. 
The 
finite, 
or 
geometric, 
rate 
of 
increase 
(X) 
is 
the 
factor 
by 
which 
the 
size 
of 
a 
population 
changes 
over 
a 
specified 
period 
(Caughley 
1977:51; 
Ricklefs 
1979:871). 
The 
exponential 
rate 
(r) 
is 
the 
power 
to 
which 
e 
(the 
base 
of 
natural 
logarithms) 
is 
raised 
such 
that 
er 
= 
X 
(Caughley 
1977:52). 
Caughley 
(1977:109) 
distinguished 
the 
following 
exponential 
rates: 
p-the 
intrinsic 
rate 
of 
increase 
in 
the 
best 
of 
all 
possible 
environments. 
Intrinsic 
rate 
of 
increase-the 
rate 
at 
which 
a 
population 
with 
a  stable 
age 
distribution 
grows 
in 
a 
given 
environment 
when 
no 
resource 
is 
in 
short 
supply 
(syn. 
Malthusian 
parameter 
[Ricklefs 
1979:874]). 
Observed 
rate 
of 
increase- 
the 
rate 
of 
increase 
at 
which 
a 
population 
increases 
over 
time. 
Potential 
rate 
of 
increase-the 
rate 
that 
would 
result 
if 
the 
effect 
of 
a 
given 
agent 
of 
mortality 
were 
eliminated. 
Survival-fecundity 
rate 
of 
increase-the 
exponential 
rate 
at 
which 
a 
population 
would 
increase 
if 
it 
had 
a  stable 
age 
distribution 
appropriate 
to 
its 
current 
schedules 
of 
age- 
specific 
survival 
and 
fecundity. 
Ricklefs 
(1979:873) 
defined 
the 
innate 
capacity 
for 
increase 
as 
the 
intrinsic 
growth 
rate 
of 
a 
population 
under 
ideal 
conditions 
without 
the 
restraining 
effects 
of 
competition. 
Recovery 
plan: 
a 
plan 
that 
details 
actions 
or 
conditions 
necessary 
to 
promote 
species 
re- 
covery, 
that 
is, 
improvement 
in 
the 
status 
of 
species 
listed 
under 
the 
Endangered 
Species 
Act 
to 
the 
point 
at 
which 
listing 
is 
no

appropriate. 
Plans 
are 
required 
for 
virtually 
all 
listed 
species 
(adapted 
from

(USFWS) 
or
